    `Hi, I'm Grace! SaaS Engineer is my official title.`,
    `When I'm not writing code, you'll probably find me deep in a new craft project, baking, playing board games, or crocheting yet another blanket I definitely don't need. I'm naturally curious and love learning for the fun of it, always jumping into new challenges.`,
    `So yes, I’m a serial hobbyist with an ever-growing collection of craft supplies and unfinished projects - a jack-of-all-trades if you will. Maybe that’s why full-stack engineering feels like home. I wouldn’t trade that chaotic joy for anything.`,

    `You can have a gander on my experiences below. But beyond the tools and tech and titles, what really drives me is the joy of solving problems, adapting quickly, and a constant desire to grow.`,
    `I pride my self in being able to pick things up fast and running with them. That's why I thrive in fast-paced, ever-evolving environments where I can explore, experiment, and build things that make life easier.`,

    `And the most important thing about me is: I love food. Like, *really* love it. Tech is great, but a perfect bowl of noodles? That’s the kind of magic I live for.`,
